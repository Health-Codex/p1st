                            <p>Medical weight loss is appropriate for most adults who want to lose weight safely and effectively under professional guidance. It's particularly beneficial for individuals with weight-related health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. During your initial consultation, our healthcare providers will determine if our program is right for you based on your medical history and health goals.</p>

                            <p>Weight loss results vary depending on individual factors such as starting weight, medical conditions, adherence to the program, and metabolism. Most patients following our program can expect to lose 1-2 pounds per week, which is considered a healthy and sustainable rate. Our focus is on helping you achieve lasting results rather than rapid weight loss that's difficult to maintain.</p>

                            <p>Not necessarily. Medication is just one tool that may be used in our weight loss programs, and it's not appropriate for everyone. Our providers will determine if medication might be beneficial based on your medical history, weight loss goals, and other factors. Many patients achieve significant results through dietary changes, exercise, and behavioral modifications alone.</p>

Some aspects of medical weight loss may be covered by insurance, particularly if you have weight-related health conditions. We'll discuss all costs during your initial consultation so you can make an informed decision.</p>
