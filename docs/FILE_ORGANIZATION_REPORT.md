- Feature-based: `feature-name.css`
- Organized by functionality

### JavaScript Files
- Descriptive names: `functionality-description.js`
- Organized by purpose and scope
- Clear separation between core and feature scripts

## Recent Cleanup Completed (July 31, 2025)

### Removed Items
- **Backup directories**: Removed all backup folders from previous fixes (complete_nav_fix_20250731_142714, js_fix_20250731_143226, etc.)
- **RSS feed directories**: Removed all WordPress RSS feed artifacts (feed/ directories in root and service directories)
- **Legacy WordPress content**: Replaced full WordPress pages with simple redirect files in service directories
- **Redundant templates**: Removed duplicate template files, consolidated to assets/templates/ and includes/
- **Loose assets**: Moved vaccine.jpg from root to assets/images/

### Preserved Structure
- **Main HTML files**: All primary pages remain in root directory for SEO and URL structure
- **Assets directory**: Well-organized structure maintained and enhanced
- **Scripts directory**: Maintenance and deployment scripts preserved
- **Documentation**: All docs preserved and updated
- **Design directory**: Mockups and design documentation maintained
- **Redirect structure**: Simple redirect files maintained for SEO purposes
